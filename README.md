# SmartString
A Lightweight C Library Meant To Mimic String Functionality In C++ 


## Ideology
The goal of this library is to provide string-like functionality similar to C++'s STL string class.  Every "smart" string worries about memory management and data organization for you, letting you better focus on your task ahead.  The "smart" string type is "s_str", and every function in this library has the prefix "s_str_".
